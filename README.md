# VR_MRI
Current solutions for modeling and interacting with MRI data lack intuition and usability. Most medical professionals choose to interact with two-dimensional slices of MRI data rather than use current solutions, such as MATLAB of three-dimensional rendering. In order to address the failures of current solutions, we propose, in this document, to create a virtual reality application that allows user to intuitively interact with three-dimensional MRI data. The main objective of the project is to prove that virtual reality is the best way to visualize and interact with MRI data. Currently, the team is in the design proposal phase and will move towards implementation when all design reviews are passed.
